My Start at something to develop some knowledge
I am starting to learn somethings about how the 21st century works.
As such I want to develop an understanding of what is impacting us and how it is impacting us.
For example- this type of thing didn't exist 10 or 15 years ago.
How strange that all of this is in its infancy and yet we cannot live without it.
